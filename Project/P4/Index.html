			<h2>Testing Document</h2>
			<p>We sat down as observers with the user testers, because we felt this would give us much more input to improvements compared to e.g a google form. We gave the user testers the following tasks, and deliberately in random order so we can see how they navigate the site:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Starting at the frontpage, find the telephone number to the clinic.</li>
				<li>Find out how much a yearly dentist check costs. Then find the price to root canal surgery with 2 teeths.</li>
				<li>Find out how many dentists that work at the clinic.</li>
				<li>Find out the clinics opening hours.</li>
				<li>Find out where Mai Gunnarsli got her dentist degree.</li>
				<li>Find out where they are located.</li>
				<li>Find info about surgery and tooth extraction.</li>
				<li>Lastly, find out if Ibsens Tannlegesenter provide youth discount.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>After the users were done testing, we asked them the following questions, to get better insights about the impression they got from the site.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What do you think about the design?</li>
				<li>Was it hard to navigate between the sites?</li>
				<li>Do you think the integrated google map was too wide?</li>
				<li>What do you think about the animations?</li>
				<li>Do you miss a scroll-to-top button?</li>
				<li>Was the text font to big/small?</li>
				<li>Overall impressions?</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Tester Audience</h2>
			<p>We sat down with 9 testers within the age group of 21-57 and asked them the questions above. The reason we followed this method, as mentioned in the testing document, is because this we felt this would give us much more direct input and value compared to other methods. Most of the testers were students as we are, but only one of the students was studying in IT. The rest was primarily our parents over the phone, who are perfect for testing our website because they are not as IT familiar such as our generation.

      <h2>Testing Platforms</h2>
			<p>We gave the different testers different platforms randomly. We gave them the usual desktop version of the site, an ipad sized screen, and lastly a mobile phone version. We used chrome primarily, since they control over 50% of the market, but we also tried them out in safari and firefox. After the test they tried out the other platforms they didn’t test just to get feedback about what they thought about other platforms.

			<h2>Feedback Summary</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>What do you think about the design? <br>
					A lot of the testers thought the design was very fitting of the site, where one tester who have worked in design for a lot of years said it was very clean, professional looking and fitting for a dentist clinic. Only one thought it was too “empty” but he didn't have a better way of describing it. This will later be fixed when we get some professional images from our client.
				</li><br>
				<li>Do you think the integrated google map was too wide? <br>
					Only one tester said that the embedded map could been smaller in width (at the same width of the footer text), but all the others had either no opinion or they felt it was fitting.
				</li><br>
				<li>What do you think about the animations? <br>
					About everybody felt that the small animation we had in the header and when you hover over the links was very cool and welcoming.
				</li><br>
				<li>Do you miss a scroll-to-top button? <br>
					When asked about if they felt the “scroll-to-top” button was missing, nobody wanted it, because they said they simply never used such a button on other sites or they said that the pages wasn’t long enough to need one.
				</li><br>
				<li>Was the text font to big/small? <br>
					Everybody felt that the font sizes was very nice and easily read. The elderly testers who tested it in mobile, who said that they have bad vision said that the font size was very readable and they didn’t have to zoom in, wich is very good since a lot of the real life customers to the clinic are elderly, or at least older than the more tech-savy millennial generation.
				</li><br>
				<li>General navigation: <br>
					All of the users thought the site was very easy to navigate in, and all who tested in mobile and ipad version understood that the hamburger menu was indeed the menu, so so sum up had nobody of the testers had any problem navigating in the site.
				</li><br>
				<li>Content on the site: <br>
					The testers said that the content was informative and usual for a dentist clinic. Nobody said that they missed something special.
				</li><br>
				<li>From the client: <br>
					The client, Mai Gunnarsli, thought the site we build was a very welcoming improvement to her old website. She thought it was much more clean and professional as she wanted. She appreciated the work we have done for her and the clinic, and for the close cooperation. As mentioned in P3, some of the content such as high-quality images and maybe a video of the clinic will be implemented at a later date when she has some content for us, so the site is not 100% to her wishes at this date, but we said that we can implement this for her at a later date when she has some content to give us.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some general “critical” feedback we got from the testers was for example when they clicked on the different employees, their name was touching the image of the employee, and that was a bit distracting. Also when the employee info was showed, one tester missed the email to that specific employee, so that he didn't have to go between contact info and about us to find the employee he wanted to for example send an email. The IT student tester thought that the prices table could have been more wide, espesial in the “Kr” section where the prices are displayed so that it don’t come over two lines in some instances. He also thought that under about us the dentist and the secretaries should have been split up to make it more clean.

			<h2>Our response</h2>
			<p>After response and listen to the “critical” feedback, we can firstly fix the “small” and easy issues where e.g when a user clicks on the employee info. There we add an  email address to each employee and fix the margin top so that the name does not get in the way for the image. Another dix we could to is to make the “kr” column in the prices table more wide so that it doesn't go over two lines. </p>
			<p>Some more complex fixes we could to is to have a separation line between the dentist and the secretaries. In P2 er actually had this, but went away from this because it was a bit hard to make in the javascript application. To the tester who thought the design was to “empty” it is harder to make concrete fixes. We agree that it could have been more content in the different sites, but that was the content we had to work with so we had to have more starting content to begin with to make a difference there. Also, the design is to reflect the clinic in a clean and professional regard, so we can’t have too much content either.</p>
			<p>To sum up there are some small changes we could make to improve the site, but some harder to make than others. And to the “empty” design there isn’t much to do since it is basically more or less supposed to be so.</p>

			<h2>Self Reflection</h2>
			<p>The project has been very educational in many ways. First and foremost the team process part. There is no secret that we had some internal conflicts and difficulties, but all in all it was a good lesson for us, as we may have to work together with somebody you don’t get along with in the future. We have been working in odd hours to get the project done, often when we thought we were done with a task, only to find out a bug or something else makes our code unreadable a day later.</p>
			<p>Secondly it is the school/professional part where we had to build a website from the bottom up and at the same time make a real client happy. This is something nobody of the group participants had done before, and therefore it was a challenging task to do. Especially when basically no one had a lot of experience in HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
			<p>To sum it all up has everybody definitely learned a lot, either in ways we wanted or not, in school terms or in being in a project group, but all in all we have only come out stronger on the other side.</p>
