			<h2>Design Changes</h2>
			<p>
				We made a plan in p2 for the website design, but while working with the site we made some design changes we think is
				better for the overall impression. The four javascript elements is also changed a bit. We are going to explain the
				different changes we made more thoroughly on every file further down, but right below is some common changes to all the
				sites.
			</p>
			<p>	
				As we started to get finished with our site we understood that the site was a bit sterile and needed to add something to
				give it some personality and life. The personality bit was difficult because we are waiting for some pictures from our
				client, but we added some animations on clickable content and color grading on our header stripe. We think that with
				some huge high resolution images as background on the desktop version will help make the site i bit less empty.
			</p>
			<p>
				We had in mind that when the user lands on the site, they should at least see that there is more content to the site, so
				they scroll down to see everything. We made it so that this also works on mobile, or any other device the user might
				have. This “trick” has been implemented on all the other sites.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another common change we have done to the site is the “titlebox” right under the heading, where in P2 we decided that it
				should be a bit further down than the heading, but we decided eventually that is should be right under the heading and
				at a height of 230 px instead of 130p, and the font size is increased a bit from P2 to make the headings more readable
				and “eye-catching”.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are aware of the meta error that won’t validate, but this is because of the scripts we have.
			</p>
			</section>

			<h2>Changes to front.html(landing page)</h2>
			<p>
				We’ve done some changes to this site, such as the picture is a little smaller, because we simply felt it was more
				aesthetic. The stripe is a little thinner, and we made the horizontal line equal to the line in the logo in the middle
				of the page. The gap between the stripe and the sections with text, “ungdomsrabatt”, “snakk med oss” and “følg oss”, is
				a little thicker than in p2, again because we felt it looked more clean. We also planned to have a javascript
				application where we use slideshow, but this was removed, and the explanation for why we did this is mentioned below in
				changes to slide_show.js.
			</p>
			</section>
			<hr>
			<section>
			<h2>Changes to about.html(about us)</h2>
			<p>
				In p2 we made two stripes with headings on this page, but we changed it down to one stripe with heading to make it more
				clean and more familiar to all the other sites, which will make the user more known to the other sites.
			</p>
			</section>
			<hr>
			<section>
			<h2>Changes to treatments.html(treatments)</h2>
			<p>
				The only changes we have done to the treatments site is that the margin-top of the content a bit further down, this is
				done to make it more clean looking.. Secondly is when the user uses a mobile device with a smaller screen, the images in
				the different treatments will be on the left, instead of the right. that it uses in full scale on a pc or a larger
				screen. This is done so that the text will not shrink as much on the left side so that it only shows a few words.
			</p>
			</section>
			<hr>
			<section>
			<h2>Changes to prices.html(pricing)</h2>
			<p>
				Here we made a new table with a complete overhaul in another more aesthetic and similar design, so that the new design
				was more correct to the rest of the site. The table also has a bit more spacing so that it is much more comfortable to
				look at, as we want a simple and clean way to display the clinics prices. We also added some new text to the site to
				inform about the “ungdomsrabatt”/youth discount. This was done to emphasize the user about the youth discount. We also
				added a new line under the text mentioned above to make a separation between them. The horizontal line is reused in many
				of the other pages, with the same design.
			</p>
			</section>
			<hr>
			<section>
			<h2>Changes to contact.html(contact us)</h2>
			<p>
				Firstly we have made a new heading box (stripe) above the contact info with the heading “Timebestilling”/Appointment
				booking. This was done to make it more similar to all the other sites and also to make it 100% clear to the user what
				this page does.
				The sub headings in the contact section have also been made more bold to make it stand out more clearly. The email
				section in the bottom has now an icon and a mini heading, so that all the sections has the same layout and design.
			</p>
			</section>
			<hr>
			<section>
			<h2>Changes to the CSS</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Instead of using px as the font size format we went for em because it’s more scalable to different screen sizes.</li>
				<li>The font sizes has been renewed:
					<ul>
						<li>h1 = 72 px -> 4em</li>
						<li>h2 = 36 px -> 2em</li>
						<li>h3 = 24 px -> 1.5 em</li>
						<li>p = 14-24px -> 0.88-1.5em</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>We needed a new color and went for #1d3a73. This color is used in the contact button in front.html and used when
				hovering over links.</li>
				<li>For the horizontal line used under many headings, we said that is should be the same blue color as in the footer, but we
				think it was more clean with a black color (#252424). This was also used in the vertical line in about.html.</li>
			</ul>
			</section>
			<hr>
			<section>
			<h2>Changes to header_animation.js(now header.js)</h2>
			<p>
				This is pretty much the same, but when the screen size shrinks in width it will be an “hamburger” menu icon that will
				pop up in the top right corner, and when the user clicks on the icon an overlay menu will fade in from the right with
				the different menu links. This was done because we thought it was much easier and user friendly, and it’s basically the
				industry standard. This script is added to every html document, this is the header for all sites. This is a script so we
				saved a lot of code in every document.
			</p>
			</section>
			<hr>
			<section>
			<h2>Changes to move_to_top.js(removed)</h2>
			<p>
				We decided to completely remove this javascript application. We felt that this was not necessary on the pages because
				there is not enough content for this to be helpful, and we thought it will only be a distraction for the user when
				he/she sees an icon slowly fade in the bottom right corner of the screen. This can also make the user move their eyes
				away from the content, which is something we don’t want. Since we had to have a minimum of four javascript applications,
				we made some new ones to replace this one, and these are mentioned below.
			</p>
			</section>
			<hr>
			<section>
			<h2>Changes to slide_show.js(removed)</h2>
			<p>
				The planned javascript application slideshow where the front image loops through different images after a set of time
				was eventually cancelled. This was done because the client (Ibsen tannlegesenter) didn't have a lot of images in the
				same size format for us to utilise, so after conversations with the client we mutually decided that this might be
				implemented at a later date if the client wants to. In the end we figured that it improved the site by not having the
				application, as it could have been seen as messy or old-fashioned by many.
			</p>
			</section>
			<hr>
			<section>
			<h2>Changes to expand.js(now about.js)</h2>
			<p>
				The biggest change on this one is the new name “about.js”. Everything else worked out the way we originally planned, and
				wanted.
			</p>
			</section>
			<hr>
			<section>
			<h2>Added footer.js</h2>
			<p>
				As with the header script, we decided that we needed a footer.js script that builds up the footer of each site when we
				link the script to the html file. This is simply, as with header.js, done so that everybody can use the same code, and
				by doing it this way we make it easier to be functional for every site.
			</p>
			</section>
			<hr>
			<section>
			<h2>Added treatments.js</h2>
			<p>
				This javascript simply populates the site treatments.html. In this case it was cleaner to make a huge javascript object
				with all the information needed for each treatment article. The site will later use frameworks that was not allowed in
				this project to implement the articles with json code instead. Almost every article is formatted with some general css,
				but it looked ok, and will be changed later anyways.
			</p>
			</section>
			<hr>
			<section>
			<h2>Modularity Requirement</h2>
			<p>
				For the modularity requirements we felt that most of our potensial repeatedly code was done with javascript such as
				header.js, footer.js, about.js and treatments.js. For the styling in CSS we have tried to keep it to a minimal and just
				the code that we need is implemented in main.css. main.css is where we store all of our css styling, so it’s easier to
				change it later.
